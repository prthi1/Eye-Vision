            <h1><i>About Low Vision</i></h1>

            <p>Low vision is both a subspeciality and a condition. Optometrists, Opticians and Ophthalmologists after
                their training may undergo further training in Low vision assessment and management. There are various
                classifications for low vision, this varies from country to country and even from state to state. It
                must however be noted that the work of a low vision specialist is very important as they aid individuals
                with reduced vision even in the presence of conventional lenses to be able to make use of their residual
                vision. People benefitting from low vision assessment must be motivated to make use of the residual
                vision and must again be willing to use the various aids that would be prescribed.
