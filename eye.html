            <h1><i>About Eye Investigation</i></h1>

            <p>An eye examination is a series of tests performed to assess vision and ability to focus on and discern
                objects. It also includes other tests and examinations pertaining to the eyes. Eye examinations are
                primarily performed by an optometrist, ophthalmologist, or an orthoptist. Health care professionals
                often recommend that all people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine
                primary care, especially since many eye diseases are asymptomatic.

                Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable blinding eye diseases, ocular manifestations of
                systemic disease, or signs of tumours or other anomalies of the brain.

                A full eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for visual
                acuity, pupil function, extraocular muscle motility, visual fields, intraocular pressure and
                ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil.
